## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).


## 🚀 Getting Started / How to Run

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) (v8.2+) & [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (or [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) / [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/sail))

### 2. Installation
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Environment setup
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

### 3. Running the Application
You need to run **both** the backend and frontend dev servers:

1. **Start the Laravel backend server:**
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
   *(This starts the backend application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`)*

2. **Start the Vite frontend asset server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *(This starts the Vite HMR server on `http://localhost:5173`)*

3. **Access the Application:**
   Open **[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)** in your browser.
   > 📌 **Important Note:** Navigating directly to `http://localhost:5173` will display the Laravel Vite placeholder page. Port `5173` is for Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) asset bundling. The web application itself is served by PHP on port `8000`.
